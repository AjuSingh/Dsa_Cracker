                    The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database <br />
                    Syntax <br />
                    SELECT column1, column2, ... <br />
                    FROM table_name; <br />
                    Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to select data <br />
                    from. If you want to select all the fields available in the table, use the following syntax <br />
                    SELECT * FROM table_name; <br />

                    Ex ‚Äì <br />
                    ‚óèSELECT CustomerName, City FROM Customers;
                </p>

                    ‚óèSELECT * FROM Customers <br />
                    WHERE Country='Mexico'</p>

                <p><span>AND, OR and NOT:</span>
                    The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators. <br />
                    The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition: <br />
                    ‚óèThe AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE. <br />
                    ‚óèThe OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE. <br />
                    The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE. <br />
                    Syntax ‚Äì <br />
                    ‚óèSELECT column1, column2, ... <br />

                <p><span>ORDER BY:</span>
                    The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.
                    The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in
                    descending order, use the DESC keyword. <br />

                <p><span> Joins:</span>
                    A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column<br />
                    between them.<br /><br />
                    INNER JOIN:<br />
                    The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.<br />

                    LEFT (OUTER) JOIN:<br />
                    The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records
                    from the right table (table2). The result is 0 records from the right side, if there is no match.<br />
                    Syntax ‚Äì<br />

                    RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN:<br />
                    The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matching<br />
                    records from the left table (table1). The result is 0 records from the left side, if there is no
                    match.<br />
                    Syntax ‚Äì<br />

                    FULL (OUTER) JOIN:<br />
                    The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right
                    (table2) table records.<br />
                    Syntax:<br />

                <p><span>UNION:</span>
                    The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.<br />
                    ‚óèEvery SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns<br />
                    ‚óèThe columns must also have similar data types<br />
                    ‚óèThe columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order<br />
                    The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate values,
                    use UNION ALL<br />
                    Syntax ‚Äì<br />
                    ‚óèSELECT column_name(s) FROM table1<br />
                    UNION<br />
                    SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;<br />

                <p><span>GROUP BY:</span>
                    The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find
                    the number of customers in each country".<br />
                    The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions<br />
                    (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more
                    columns.<br />

                <p><span>HAVING:</span>
                    The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with
                    aggregate functions.<br />
                    *WHERE is given priority over HAVING.<br />

                <p><span>ALTER TABLE:</span>
                    The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table. <br/>
                    The ALTER TABLE statement is also used to add and drop various constraints on an existing
                    table.<br/>
                    Syntax ‚Äì<br/>
